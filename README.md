## Vacations
We decided to take a vacation to San Francisco after I spent the summer seeing my brother at Stanford. We saw many breathtaking sights and had many unforgettable encounters on our vacation. We began our journey by taking a leisurely stroll around Fisherman's Wharf, where the vibrant ambiance, quaint stores, and irresistible scent of freshly caught seafood enthralled us. We made sure to sample some of the delicious seafood specialties that the area had to offer. We next went to Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden. The calm and well-kept garden offered a tranquil diversion from the bustle of the city. We relished the peace of the tea house, strolling down the meandering walks and taking in the views of the koi ponds. Getting to ride the renowned cable car and the cutting-edge Waymo self-driving car for the first time was one of the highlights of our trip. Enjoying the breathtaking sights and a glimpse of San Francisco's past, taking the cable car was a nostalgic trip through the city. The Waymo self-driving car, on the other hand, offered a glimpse into the future of transportation, and it was amazing to watch how well the technology functioned in the city. Compared to LA, we were blessed with the perfect weather, which made our trip even more enjoyable.

## Volunteer Work or Cummunity Service during Summer 
I spent the summer volunteering at Kaiser Permanente with two of my friends. Our activity was a great way for us to bond and was also quite satisfying. We would come together every day at 2:00 PM to share a 45 minute break. We used these breaks to unwind, talk, and spend quality time with each other, which turned them into the highlights of our days. During our breaks we went to the cafeteria to get a little snack and find a spot to sit and talk, it not only made our day enjoyable but made us closer. 

## Fav Summer food!!!!
UGHHHH I'm a foodie and I love love love trying out food from different cultures and just trying new things. but during the summer I tried making sushi at home it wasnt the best looking wise but it tasted really really good. But during the summer I ate sushi and ramen so much. Ramen is chef's kiss. Sushi i usually eat at a resturant called Agua Chiles Sushi Bar.

## Future Aspirations
Nearly every member of my family wears glasses, and everyone has poor vision. My little cousin brother has albinism, which causes him to have very weak vision, and my grandma is completely blind. They all have stunning eye colors despite these difficulties; my grandma and cousin, like myself, have vivid blue eyes. This has always piqued my interest and led to my obsession with the functioning of the eyes. The eyes are such a delicate and intricate feature of the human face, and I find it astounding. Growing up in a household where vision problems are common, I have a good understanding of the significance of eye health and how it affects day to day functioning especially living with them and helping them with things around the house. My personal experience has given me more desire to learn more about opthalmology.
