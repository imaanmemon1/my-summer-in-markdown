# Introduction
Hello! My name is Imaan Memon and I am a senior in high school. 
## What did I do over the summer? 
I visited my brother at Stanford during the summer before my senior year, and we later took a vacation to San Francisco. There, we strolled through Fisherman's Warf and visited the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park. We experienced both the cable car and the Waymo self-driving car for the first time. Along with two of my friends, I worked as a volunteer at Kaiser Permanente during the summer. We would meet up at 2:00 to take a 45-minute break together, so it was a really enjoyable experience. It is one of the best memories I have with my friends during the summer and I would look forward to the days of my week to spend it with them.
